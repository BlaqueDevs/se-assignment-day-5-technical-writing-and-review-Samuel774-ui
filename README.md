### **6. **“Execute” vs. “Run”**
   - **Technical Term:** “Execute the script to apply the changes.”
   - **Simplified Term:** “Run the script to apply the changes.”
   - **Explanation:** “Run” is a more commonly used term in everyday language, making it easier for users to understand the action compared to “execute,” which may sound more technical.

### **7. **“Interface” vs. “Screen”**
   - **Technical Term:** “Navigate through the interface to find the settings.”
   - **Simplified Term:** “Navigate through the screen to find the settings.”
   - **Explanation:** “Screen” is a more concrete term and easier to visualize, making it more accessible than “interface,” which may be less familiar to some users.

### **Example Application**

In a software manual:

- **Technical Term:** “Initialize the database by running the schema setup script.”
- **Simplified Term:** “Set up the database by running the setup script.”

**Explanation:** The simplified term “set up” is easier to understand and more directly conveys the action, making it clearer for users who may not be familiar with technical terminology.

By using simpler terms, you make instructions and information more relatable and easier to understand, ensuring that users of all backgrounds can follow along and effectively use the content.

   - **Description:** Headings and subheadings should clearly describe the content of the section they introduce. Avoid vague or overly broad terms.
   - **Best Practice:** Use precise language that reflects the specific topic or subtopic of the section.
   - **Example:** Instead of “Setup,” use “Installing the Software on Windows” for clarity.

### **2. **Use a Hierarchical Structure**
   - **Description:** Organize headings and subheadings in a logical hierarchy to show the relationship between different sections.
   - **Best Practice:** Use main headings for broad topics, subheadings for specific aspects, and sub-subheadings for detailed information.
   - **Example:** 
     - **Main Heading:** “Features”
       - **Subheading:** “User Interface”
         - **Sub-subheading:** “Navigation Menu”

### **3. **Keep Them Concise**
   - **Description:** Headings and subheadings should be brief and to the point. Long headings can be overwhelming and reduce readability.
   - **Best Practice:** Aim for clarity and brevity, using just enough words to convey the main idea.
   - **Example:** Use “Creating a New Project” instead of “How to Create a New Project in the Application.”

### **4. **Use Consistent Formatting**
   - **Description:** Maintain a uniform style for headings and subheadings throughout the document to enhance readability and coherence.
   - **Best Practice:** Follow a consistent format for font size, style (bold, italics), and numbering.
   - **Example:** If main headings are bold and size 14, ensure all main headings throughout the document follow this format.

### **5. **Include Keywords**
   - **Description:** Incorporate relevant keywords in headings and subheadings to make it easier for readers to find specific information and improve document searchability.
   - **Best Practice:** Use terms that reflect the main concepts or processes covered in the section.
   - **Example:** For a section on database backups, use “Database Backup Procedures” instead of just “Backup.”

### **6. **Avoid Jargon and Technical Terms**
   - **Description:** If the document is intended for a broad audience, minimize the use of jargon or technical terms in headings and subheadings.
   - **Best Practice:** Use plain language that is easily understood by the target audience.
   - **Example:** Use “Updating Your Account Information” instead of “Account Management Configuration.”

### **7. **Reflect Document Structure**
   - **Description:** Ensure that headings and subheadings accurately represent the structure and content of the document.
   - **Best Practice:** Review headings to confirm they align with the actual content and flow of the document.
   - **Example:** If a section covers multiple steps, make sure subheadings reflect each step clearly.

### **8. **Incorporate Action Verbs**
   - **Description:** Using action verbs in headings and subheadings can make them more engaging and directive.
   - **Best Practice:** Start headings with verbs that indicate the action or process described in the section.
   - **Example:** Use “Configure Network Settings” instead of “Network Settings Configuration.”

### **9. **Use Parallel Structure**
   - **Description:** Maintain parallel structure for headings and subheadings to ensure consistency and readability.
   - **Best Practice:** Ensure all headings and subheadings in a section follow the same grammatical format (e.g., all starting with verbs).
   - **Example:** 
     - “Understanding the Interface”
     - “Navigating the Interface”
     - “Customizing the Interface”

### **10. **Test for Readability**
   - **Description:** Check that headings and subheadings are easy to read and understand. Test them with potential readers if possible.
   - **Best Practice:** Use feedback to refine headings and ensure they communicate the intended message effectively.
   - **Example:** Ask a colleague to review headings and suggest improvements based on their clarity and relevance.

### **Example Application**
